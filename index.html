                      Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the
                      inputs and the desired outputs.[18] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of
                      training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and a desired output, also known
                      as a supervisory signal. In the case of semi-supervised learning algorithms, some of the training
                      examples are missing the desired output. In the mathematical model, each training example is
                      represented by an array or vector, and the training data by a matrix. Through iterative
                      optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be
                      used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[19] An optimal function will allow the
                      algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.
                      An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have
                      learned to perform that task.[6]

                      Supervised learning algorithms include classification and regression.[20] Classification
                      algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression
                      algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. Similarity
                      learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and
                      classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures
                      how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems,
                      visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.

                      Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure
                      in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms therefore learn from test
                      data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback,
                      unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the
                      presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of
                      unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics,[21] though unsupervised
                      learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.

                      Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that
                      observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria,
                      while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques
                      make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric
                      and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same
                      cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated
                      density and graph connectivity.

                      Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to
                      take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its
                      generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory,
                      operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm
                      intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.[22][23] In machine learning, the environment is
                      typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms
                      use dynamic programming techniques.[22][23][24] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume
                      knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are
                      infeasible.[22][23] Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in
                      learning to play a game against a human opponent.
